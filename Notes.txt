Your volumes will be available in the /home/login/data folder


    
    ## Step 8: Host Configuration
    
    ### Configure domain in VM:
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/hosts
    ```
    Add (replace 'login' with your 42 login):
    ```
    127.0.0.1 login.42.fr
    ```
    
    ### Create data directories:
    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /home/$USER/data/mariadb
    sudo mkdir -p /home/$USER/data/wordpress
    sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /home/$USER/data
    ```
    
    ## Key Points for Evaluation:
    
    1. **Image names match service names** (mariadb, wordpress, nginx)
    2. **Volumes mounted to `/home/login/data/`** (visible in `docker-compose ps`)
    3. **Each container has only its intended service**
    4. **NGINX serves HTTPS with SSL certificate**
    5. **WordPress connects to MariaDB**
    6. **No complex initialization scripts**
    
    This approach focuses on simplicity and meeting the exact evaluation criteria rather than over-engineering the setup.
